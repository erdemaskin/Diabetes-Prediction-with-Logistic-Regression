# Business Problem:

# Whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified.
# a machine learning that can predict whether they are not
# can you improve the model?

# The dataset is of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA.
# is the part. Persons aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona in the USA
# Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women. 768 observations and 8 numerical
# consists of arguments. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 diabetes test result
# indicates positive, 0 indicates negative.

# Variables
# Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
# Glucose: Glucose.
# BloodPressure: Blood pressure.

# Age: Age (years)
# Outcome: Information whether the person has diabetes or not. Have the disease (1) or not (0)
